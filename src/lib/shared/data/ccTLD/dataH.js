Third level domains (example.com.hr) are allowed to be registered for anyone in the world as long as they provide a local contact. `,
      `There are also third-level registrations including of individuals in a few specialized domains such as .iz.hr (.from.hr), and an unlimited number of registrations in .com.hr, but these are unpopular compared to the second-level names registered directly under .hr.`,
