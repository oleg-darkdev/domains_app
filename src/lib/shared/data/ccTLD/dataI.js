The abundance of available short names has also made the domain popular for personal use. `,

      `The rapid rise of Agar.io (2015) and Slither.io (2016) led to the beginning of a new genre of browser games, dubbed ".io games" for the domain name they use. Characterized by simple graphics and gameplay in a free for all multiplayer arena, .io games received around 192 million visits in 2017.[23][24][25] Many .io shooters launched after Slither.io—Valadares released Diep.io in July 2016. Miniclip also began developing new .io games.`,
