      `Even though the Soviet Union itself was dissolved 15 months later, the .su top-level domain remains in use to the present day. It is administered by the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN, or RosNIIROS in Russian transcription).`,
      `he .su ccTLD is known for usage by cybercriminals.`,
      `After 1989 a set of new internet domains was created in Europe, including .pl (Poland), .cs (Czechoslovakia), .yu (Yugoslavia) and .dd (East Germany). Among them, there was also a domain for the USSR – .su.[7] Initially, before two-letter ccTLDs became standard, the Soviet Union was to receive a .ussr domain. The .su domain was proposed by the 19-year-old Finnish student Petri Ojala.[8] On 26 December 1991 the country was dissolved and its constituent republics gained independence, which should have caused the domain to begin a phase-out process, as happened with those of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Until 1994[7] there was no assigned top-level domain name for Russia. For this reason the country continued to use the Soviet domain. In 1994 the .ru domain was created, which was supposed to eventually replace the .su domain[7] (domains for the republics other than Russia were created at different times in the mid-nineties). The domain was supposed to be withdrawn by ICANN, but it was kept at the request of the Russian government and Internet users.`,
      `The domain was intended to be used by Soviet institutions and companies operating in the USSR. The dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that the new TLD was superseded by the new country TLDs of the former Soviet republics. Despite this, .su is still in use. Most of the .su domains are registered in Russia and the United States.[11] According to the RU-CENTER data from May 2010, there were over 93,500 registered domains with the .su TLD (there are over 2.8 million .ru domains).[12] Some organizations with roots in the former Soviet Union also still use this TLD.[6] The pro-Russian Ukrainian separatist group Donetsk People's Republic have also registered their domain with the TLD.[13] The .su domain also hosts white supremacist websites that have been deplatformed elsewhere, formerly including The Daily Stormer.`,
      `The domain has been reported to host many cybercrime activities[15][5][4] due to the relaxed and outdated terms of use, along with staying out of focus (2% usage comparing to the primary .ru zone).[4][16] Rules for timely suspension of malicious domains[16] have been in place since 2013 in response to the issue.`
