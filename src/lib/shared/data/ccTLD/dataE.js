    notes: [
      `The top-level domain .ee was introduced in 1992 and was operated by EENet until July 2010. The administrator of .ee domain was the academic Endel Lippmaa. There was a limit of one domain name per legal entity, and registrations of additional names to protect trademarks were specifically denied because "The domain name has no trademark status".`,
      `As domains under .ee were meant to be an institution's identification on the Internet (like the register code in the commercial register), registration of additional domains in the defense of a trademark or a name form is not possible.[5] Valid registrations were free of charge. `,
      `The new order of registration of .ee TLD became available on 5 July 2010. Estonian Internet Foundation took over .ee ccTLD registry functions from EENet. With the new domain rules, both private individuals and foreigners can register an unlimited number of domains directly under .ee. Domain name registration is done on two levels, .ee domain registrants are serviced by authorized registrars.`,
      `Also, payment of registry administration from the state budget was stopped and a fee was established for domain registration. All existing domains registered before the transition had to be re-registered during a 6-month transition period which ended on 5 January 2011. Registration services can be done through accredited registrars listed on Estonian Internet Foundation website. Domain disputes are handled by Domain Disputes Committee`,
      `The new order of domain registering in 2010 was met with great controversy. The relaunch of the registry was at one point delayed to be reassessed.[11] When the relaunch was finalized, the annual fee for a .ee domain was announced to be 285 Estonian kroons (18.2 euros) plus tax, which was met with wide criticism.[12] A list of shortcomings was presented in a public notice to Estonian Internet Foundation by Tõnu Samuel and Jaan Jänesmäe, mentioning that the .ee domain had become the most expensive TLD in Europe.[12] Their cause gained over 800 supporters on Facebook.`,
      `The NGO Estonian Internet Community was founded partly as a reaction to the controversial domain reform with 22 founding members.[13] Its board is made up of Tõnu Samuel, Elver Loho and Heiti Kender. In 2010 it noted on its blog that several of its members had lost faith in the possibility of any sort of compromise and had independently written e-mails to IANA asking them to step in to resolve the controversy.`,
      `Over the following years the annual fee has gradually dropped,[15] reaching 6 euros on 1 January 2017.`

      `On April 1, 2013 the Canadian Internet Registration Authority announced it would be releasing .eh domain names to consumers as part of an April Fools' Day joke, the TLD being a play on the stereotypical Canadian interjection "eh".`,

      `On August 1, 2007, an international consortium[which?] made a bid to IANA to administer the .eh domain on behalf of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Morocco, which controls most of Western Sahara, has made competing claims to the domain.`,
      `On October 16, 2007, ccTLD decided not to delegate .eh at all, with the explanation that: "there are currently two applicants for the delegation of the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) .EH (Western Sahara). Both requests meet the technical criteria for managing a top-level domain. In cases like this, IANA has a long-standing policy of requesting that the two contesting applicants work together to find a mutual solution that will serve the needs of the local Internet community in the best possible fashion. ccTLD does not see a way to approve the .EH ccTLD delegation to one of the applicants without violating its long-standing policy unless the contesting parties are able to reach an agreement."`,
