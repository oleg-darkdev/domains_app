      `In recent years, the .re TLD has been increasingly used for real estate–related domains (RE = Real Estate), including place names (neighborhoods, cities, countries, etc.), real estate companies, developers/projects, property-related websites, and individual realtors and estate agents around the world. The .re domain has also been applied to insurance and reinsurance companies (e.g. swiss.re), those involved with reverse engineering, and as domain hacks for words ending in .re (for example, adventu.re or nearfutu.re), similar to contractions used with other TLDs (for example, websites such as bit.ly and delicio.us). Domains with the .re TLD can be registered with some of the largest online registrars such as Name.com, as well as most European domain registrars. `,
      `Since 6 December 2011, the rules for registering French domains have shifted. The owner of a domain no longer needs to be based in France or Overseas France anymore, with all individuals, companies and organizations residing in the European Union able register domains of France or its possessions.`,
