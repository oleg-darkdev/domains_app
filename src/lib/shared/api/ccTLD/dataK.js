In 2002 direct management of the ccTLD was transferred to Telecom Services Kiribati Limited.`,
      `This initial set up was done by Franck Martin. As of 2007, the registry is being handled by the Telecommunications Authority of Kiribati using a system of multiple registrars similar to that used by gTLDs; however, few sites are using .ki domains. Because of the location of Kiribati and limited Internet connection, it is not uncommon for a website in Kiribati, such as a government website, to be very slow or inaccessible; however, many .ki sites are hosted outside Kiribati.`,
