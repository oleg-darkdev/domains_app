During a Finance Committee the MPs pressed ICT minister John Nasasira to explain how the private company came to own the domain, which could endanger national security.`,

      `Registry services were formerly operated by Euracom GmBH, but were later redelegated to UZINFOCOM.

      `In Latvia, .uz is used as short-link address — ej.uz,[1] which means "go to".`,
      `Initially, the domain name "UZ" was issued free of charge until 2001. Then the registrar LLC "Tomas" took $89 per year for domain registration, with its subsequent reduction. In 2002, the price was reduced to $78, and from January 2003 - to $50 per year, and until 2005 it was $40. At the moment, the average price for domain registration in the "UZ" zone is 25,000 soums. The decline in prices began thanks to the emergence of six more official registrars since 2005. Currently, almost 92000 active domains are registered in the domain zone.`,
      `In September 2019, to protect domain owners from cybersquatting, the Redemption Period service was introduced, thanks to which the former domain owners, after the expiration of the registration period, have the right to redeem the expired domain in their own name.`,
